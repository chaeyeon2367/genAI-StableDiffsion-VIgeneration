### üìå What is Stable diffusion?

Stable Diffusion is a generative AI technique that involves the controlled diffusion of information throughout a system. Diffusion models are probabilistic models that describe how data, in this case, an image, changes or diffuses over time. The stable diffusion approach aims to create high-quality and diverse images by iteratively applying controlled diffusion processes to an initial image.

In the context of AI and creative applications, stable diffusion is often used to generate visually appealing and novel artworks. By manipulating the diffusion process through prompts and input parameters, users can guide the AI in creating unique and imaginative images. The stability in diffusion refers to the controlled and coherent evolution of the image during the generation process.

The technique is versatile, allowing users to explore a wide range of creative possibilities by influencing factors such as lighting, style, environment, and more. It is particularly popular in the field of generative art, where artists and AI enthusiasts leverage stable diffusion to produce captivating and diverse visual content.

### ü§ñ Stable Diffusion models(checkpoint)

The Stable Diffusion model, akin to the artist who draws in the space provided by the Stable Diffusion webui, is the entity responsible for creating images. In other words, choosing a model is comparable to selecting the artist who will be drawing. While techniques like LoRA, embedding, hypernetwork, and others are capable of generating images, the model or checkpoint serves as the artist; without it, there is no one to create the artwork. Therefore, having the right model (checkpoint) is essential for the generation of images in the Stable Diffusion framework.

In the same way, choosing a model is akin to selecting the artist, and just as the style of an artwork varies depending on who is drawing, the images generated differ significantly based on the choice of the model. There are two main websites where you can download these models.

  - Civitai : <https://civitai.com>

  - Hugging face : <https://huggingface.co>

</br> 

#### üìÇ Checkpoint(model) files (.safetensors , .ckpt)

The model files with the extensions .safetensors and .ckpt are related to the Stable Diffusion webui and represent different aspects of the model:

   - safetensors : This file contains tensors (data structures representing multi-dimensional arrays) related to the model.
It may include information about the model's architecture, parameters, and other essential components.
The ".safetensors" extension suggests that the data stored in this file is considered safe or stable for the model's functioning.

   - 'ckpt' : This file typically represents a checkpoint file and contains the saved weights and biases of the model.
It allows the model to be saved and restored at a later time, enabling users to continue training or deploy the model without starting from scratch.
The ".ckpt" extension is a common convention in machine learning to denote checkpoint files.

  - **Parameters**
    
    - **Sampling Steps** : the number of steps or iterations during the sampling process. A higher value may result in more detailed and refined images but will require more computational resources.
    - **Sampling Method** : Refers to the technique used for sampling during image generation. Different methods can influence the diversity and quality of generated images. 
    - **CFG Scale** : Stands for "config scale." It represents a scaling factor for the configuration settings, influencing the overall size and structure of the generated images.
    - **Batch Size** : The number of samples processed in one iteration. A larger batch size can speed up training but requires more memory.
    - **Size (Width, Height)** : Defines the dimensions of the generated images. Specified as width and height, this setting determines the resolution and aspect ratio of the output images.
    - **Seed** : A seed is an initial value used to start the randomization process. Setting a seed allows for reproducibility, ensuring that running the model with the same seed produces the same results.

## 4. How to Write Prompts

A prompt is a concise and specific input provided to a generative model to guide its content creation. It typically consists of a brief textual description or set of instructions that influences the output of the model. In the context of Stable Diffusion webui, prompts are used to shape the characteristics, style, or subject matter of the generated images or videos. 

</br>

### (1) Prompt / Negative prompt

Stable Diffusion webui has two input fields for prompts. The first is called the positive prompt, and the second is called the negative prompt. In the positive prompt, you include the content you want reflected in the generated images, while in the negative prompt, you include the content you prefer not to be reflected. However, it's important to note that not everything included in the prompts will be entirely reflected or excluded based on positive or negative prompts.

</br>

### (2) Token

A token, in simple terms, can be thought of as a unit of text, often corresponding to a single character or word. In the context of prompt writing, the number of tokens refers to the count of these text units. The prompt input field in the upper right corner of the Stable Diffusion webui displays the token count. It's recommended to keep prompts within 75 tokens, as the interpretation process divides the text into segments of 75 tokens each. This limitation ensures effective processing and interpretation of the input prompt.

</br>

### (3) Weight

Weight, in simple terms, refers to the influence or impact of a prompt. A prompt without a specified weight is assigned a default weight of 1. You can increase the influence of a prompt by assigning a weight, and there are two ways to do so:

  - **Enclose in Parentheses** : You can enclose the prompt in parentheses to give it additional weight. For example:(best quality)

  - **Colon Notation** : Alternatively, you can use colon notation to explicitly specify the weight. For example: (best quality:1.5)

In this case, a prompt with a weight has a greater impact compared to a prompt without any weight. However, it's essential not to set excessively high weights for a single prompt, as it may negatively affect the generated image. It is generally recommended to set weights within the range of 0.8 to 1.5 to maintain a balance and avoid potential image degradation.

</br>

### (4) Sentence Type / Tag Type Prompts

  - **Sentence Type Prompts** : Sentence type prompts are structured phrases or sentences that provide detailed descriptions in a sentence or clause format. They are ideal for expressing elements like composition, scenario, or actions. Examples include prompts describing appearance, state, background, etc.
    - Example of Sentence Type Prompt: (standing on the table),(looking at window)

  - **Tag Type Prompts** : Tag type prompts consist of single-word prompts that act as concise tags representing specific attributes such as appearance, state, or background. They are more focused and efficient for conveying certain aspects of the desired image.
    - Example of Tag Type Prompt: (black_hair),(white_background)
  
</br>

## 7. Video Generation with Deforum

</br>
Deforum is an open-source animation tool that leverages Stable Diffusion's image-to-image function to produce dynamic video content. The process involves generating a sequence of images and then stitching them together to create a coherent video.

The animation is achieved by applying slight transformations to each frame. The image-to-image function is utilized to generate subsequent frames, ensuring that the transitions between frames are minimal. This approach creates the illusion of smooth continuity, resulting in a visually pleasing and fluid video.

</br>

- **Parameters**

    - **Translation (x, y, z)** : Translation represents the movement of the image in three-dimensional space. Translation x,y,z denotes movement along the x,y,z-axis.

    - **Rotation (3d x, y, z)** : Rotation deals with the orientation or rotation of the image in three-dimensional space. Rotation 3d x,y,z represents rotation around the x,y,z-axis.

    - **Noise Schedule** : The noise schedule refers to a predefined plan or sequence for introducing noise during the generation process. It helps control the randomness or variability in the generated images or video frames. Adjusting the noise schedule can influence the level of detail, texture, or unpredictability in the final output.
